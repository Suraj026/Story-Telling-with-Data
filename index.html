                The age distribution graph highlights a significant
                concentration of individuals around the
                <strong>ages of 18 to 20</strong>, with a noticeable decline
                beyond this range. This suggests that
                <strong>younger individuals are more actively engaged</strong>
                in sports and fitness-related activities, emphasizing the role
                of youth in adopting an active lifestyle.

                individuals with <strong>mid-to-high fitness levels</strong>,
                particularly in the <strong>range of 6 to 8</strong>. This
                suggests that while many people maintain a decent level of

                The daily step count distribution exhibits a pattern with
                <strong>peaks around 4,000 and 8,000 steps</strong>, indicating
                that many individuals fall into these activity levels. While a
                portion of the population achieves the
                <strong>recommended 10,000 steps per day</strong>, others remain

                also have a notable following, sports like swimming and tennis
